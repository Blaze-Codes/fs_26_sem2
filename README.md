In this semester, I try to structure the topics I'm going to learn about a bit differently.
To keep things organised, I have decided to do this via a website I'm hosting here.

Here are the topics the spring semester of 2026 is going to cover:
	Digitial Design & Computer Architecture (DDCA)
	Parallel Programming (PP or PProg)
	Analysis 1 (A1)
	Algorithms & Probability (A&W)

A small note: 
All lectures, with the exception of DDCA, are going to be in German.
Therefore, my notes will include both English and German.

For a good overview, you might be interested to go to cs.shivi.io, a great website from another student at ETH.
