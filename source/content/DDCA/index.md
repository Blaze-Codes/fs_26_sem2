# Tasks, Deadlines and Bonus Points
## Tasks
Meant to help learn and prepare for exam.
## Lab Sessions

All of this will result in up to 30% of the final grade.

TLDR: **ATTENDANCE** is very important, and **DO YOUR JOB (well)**. 
## Office Hours
Maybe? I will come back to it later
## Bonus Points
None.
