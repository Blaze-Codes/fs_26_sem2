title: Welcome to my notes for the second semester CS @ETHZ
---
In this semester, I try to structure the topic I'm going to learn a bit differently. To keep things organised, I have decided to do this via a website I'm hosting here.

Furthermore, I will probably only note things down, that I think are fundamental, important or I have trouble dealing with. Thus, it is personalized for me, not for you! For a more general overview, consider [Shivi's website](cs.shivi.io).

Here are the topics the spring semester of 2026 is going to cover: 
- Digitial Design & Computer Architecture ([[DDCA/index|DDCA]]) 
- Parallel Programming ([[PP/index|PP or PProg]]) 
- Analysis 1 ([[A1/index|A1]]) 
- Algorithms & Probability ([[A&W/index|A&W]])

A small note: All lectures, with the exception of DDCA (being in English), are going to be in German. Therefore, my notes will include both English and German.
