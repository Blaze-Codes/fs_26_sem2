# Exam

## Structure
The structure is basically identical to A&D in the first semester.
Length: 180 minutes (3 hours)
It consists of three parts:
- Multiple Choice / Moodle
- Written Part
- Programming in Code Expert


## Grading With Bonus Points
$$final\_grade = round(exam\_grade + bonus\_grade)$$
with rounding being to the nearest quarter grade (i.e. 5.17 -> 5.25), and $bonus\_grade$ calculated as $$bonus\_grade = 0.25 * min(1, bonus_points / (0.8 * max\_bonus\_points))$$
i.e., to get the full bonus_grade (0.25), one has to obtain at least 80% of the max bonus points.

## Cheatsheet
A small cheatsheet containing fomula and notations is given by the examiners. No personal cheatsheet
