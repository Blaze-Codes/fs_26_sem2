Bonus Points: $N/A$
Note: as far as I know, it makes up 100% of the bonus points.

# Exam

## Structure
Length: 180 minutes (3 hours)
Type: written

## Grading With Bonus Points
$$final\_grade = round(exam\_grade + bonus\_grade)$$
as of now, it is not known if one has to get 100% of the bonus points for the full bonus, or if, say 80%, is needed.
